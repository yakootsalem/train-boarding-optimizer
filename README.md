## Details about the Project

The **Train Boarding Optimizer** is an IoT-based system designed to **optimize and simulate passenger boarding** in a train environment.  
It combines **ESP32 microcontrollers**, **ultrasonic sensors**, a **Firebase Realtime Database**, and a **Flutter application**.

The system uses ultrasonic sensors mounted on train seats to detect when a passenger sits down (distance < 80 cm).  
The ESP32 sends this data to Firebase, which is then visualized in real-time through a Flutter app that simulates train movement between two stations.

## System Description

### ESP32 Firmware
- Each ESP32 board represents one **train cabin** (A, B, Câ€¦).
- It connects to **two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors**, one per seat.
- When an object is detected within **80 cm**, the seat is marked as **occupied**.
- Data is pushed to Firebase:
